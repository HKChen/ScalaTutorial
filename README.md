>This is scala tutorial from "Programming in Scala 2nd" on Eclipse by myself. 
>Because, I thought that learning scala is not enough on console mode.
>I'm working on scala version 2.11.8 and Eclipse IDE on OS X.
>And I'll write extra codes to compare with booksite codes.
>Hope it will help you to understand the Scala process.
>You can download the booksite code here http://booksites.artima.com/programming_in_scala_2ed
>There have codes that can't run in old version, I'll tip you :)
